# fibroid-gene-expression
The projects investigates the differential gene expression amongst fibroid and normal tissue samples. The workflow encompasses the data preprocessing, normalization, dimensionality reduction, and the statistical testing to identify the genes associated with fibroid pathology. The analysis provides a pipeline to identify the canidate genes and expression patterns that are noteable to the uterine fibroids.
